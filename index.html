									<p>After 20 successful years in the restaurant industry I have made the career transition to full stack developer. My strengths in effective communication, attention to detail, and problem solving have made me successful in both my restaurant career and summiting remote peaks. I'm now leveraging those strengths to develop creative solutions to challenging technical problems in web development. It's been an awesome journey and it's only just beginning!</p>

									<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
									<p>I am reworking this section.</p>
									<p>I built this page after graduating from Actualize coding bootcamp. I am currently working in my first role as a web software developer for Montana State University. I have continued to grow my skill set and am gaining valuable experience working on a wide variety of projects. My main duties involve front-end development. We are building apps for the MSU faculty using the MEVN stack. I have built a few custom pages for the marketing team which involve advanced CSS and I've gotten very familiar with Tailwind.</p>
									<p>I plan on rebuilding this site from scratch using Vue.js and Tailwind. I am also working on a few personal projects that I will be adding to my portfolio soon.</p>

									<h3>More About Me</h3>
									<p>I have always been an adventurer. After completing university at CU Boulder with a bachelors degree in both Communication and Philosophy I moved to Aspen, CO to live out my dream as a skier and mountaineer.</p>
									<p>I spent 20 years in the restaurant industry to support my mountain lifestyle. I loved the fast paced, think-on-your-toes, heavy social interaction of working in the restaurant environment. I could work in the evenings and had a very flexible schedule. I was very successful at each of the restaurants I worked for and really appreciate the time I spent in the industry.</p>
									<p>As I grew older my priorities shifted from the mountains to my family and I began to consider a more sustainable career. I wanted a new challenge that was mentally stimulating and less physically demanding. I have been interested in coding since I was young and have always had a knack for tech. I want to contribute to an increasingly digital future and love the idea of building things from scratch. Actualize has lit a fire inside me and given me the tools I need to begin my path as a developer. I have fully embraced the growth mindset and am ready to make my mark!</p>

												<h4>Did I mention Curry?</h4>
												<p>Curry is our hilarious miniature dachshund. He's a mountain weenie who is up for anything. His legs may be small but his energy is endless. He is mostly a good boy but can sometimes be a wild and crazy maniac. He plays by his own rules!</p>
