				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I have always been an adventurer. After completing university at CU Boulder with a bachelors in Communication
					and Philosophy I moved to Aspen, CO to live out my dream as a mountaineer. While this was very personally
					fulfulling it left a lot to be desired professionaly.</p>
				<p>I spent 20 years in the restaurant industry to support my mountain lifestyle. I loved the fast paced,
					think-on-your-toes, heavy social interaction of working in that restaurant environment. I could work in the evening and had a very flexible schedule. I was very successful
					at each of the restaurants I worked for and really appreciate the time I spent in the industry.</p>
				<p>As I grew older and life got more serious I began to think about how I could pivot careers into an industry
					that would be more sustainable long term. I have been interesting in coding since I was young, writing
					fileserve scripts in my teenage software pirating days. It has always been a spark in the back of my mind just
					waiting to be unlocked.</p>
				<p>I joined the Actualize Coding Bootcamp in March of 2020 and have rediscovered a passion for software
					development. It's been incredibly refreshing to start down a new career path and feel excited about going to
					work every day! The sky is the limit and I am commited to a life time of never ending learning and creativity!
				</p>
				<p>You can still find me adventuring in the mountains except now I've got my young daughter, my crazy minature
					dachsand and my wife by my side. Life is good :)</p>
